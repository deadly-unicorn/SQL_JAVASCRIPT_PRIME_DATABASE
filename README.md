# SQL_JAVASCRIPT_PRIME_DATABASE

## Background: 
I had just started experimenting with SQL (after learning the basics from the Mimo APP), and I was also having some conversations with a friend of mine, who is studying math. By that time we might had been having lessons around numeral systems at school.

Then I got a bit curious about prime numbers in Hexidecimal and wanted to just look what they look like, so I decided to make an app that 

1. ### Finds prime numbers  
	Nothing too special here, just needed something that worked. I might have used as a reference a similar app I had made in python some **decades\** ago, though I don't remember clearly if that's what I actually did. 
2. ### Converts them to hex
	Questioning about it now are hex primes == decimal primes? I haven't thought about it.
		
The above numbers are stored in variables.

3. ### Outputs an SQL query
	For each prime number pair (Hex-Dec).
	
Then, I basically just copied all of the queries and pasted them on SQL *console?\* so that it added the rows of pairs to a local MariaDB.

I could then copy and paste the pairs to an Excel? I am not sure if that's what I did in the end. 
But yes. That's what this app was about.
